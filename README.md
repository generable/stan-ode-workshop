# stan-ode-workshop
Stan ODE workshop for StanCon 2018 Helsinki


## Example

We are using the simple harmonic oscillator as our example. There are two states, y1 and y2.

The derivatives of the states with respect to time are:

- dy1/dt = y2
- dy2/dt = -y1 - theta * y2

where theta is some parameter. In the manual, the example is set up so at time 0, the initial condition is (1, 0) and the value of theta is 0.15.
